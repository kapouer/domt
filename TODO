* filter(val) would be nicer if it also gave the current key,
  which is particularly useful if a hash array is being iterated:
  [colors.#key|receivesKey]
  [colors.#val|receivesVal]
  [colors|receivesVal]

* find other semantics for looping over object key, val

* repeat-invert shouldn't really exists ?

* add an option to *not* require e.g. bind-class="" class="item [val]"
  meaning Domt always tries to process the attribute and decides what
  to do afterwise. - idem for html or text content

* make sure Domt isn't called on an already processed list ? or at least
  warn somehow.

* allow passing directly a to-be-repeated node (not a parent of it)
  provided it has actually a parent in the DOM.

* allow modification of repeated node
